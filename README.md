# Elixir/Phoenix Study Project

## Introduction

This is a study project created to learn Elixir and the Phoenix framework. It serves as a practical application for understanding web development in the Elixir ecosystem.

## Project Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To gain hands-on experience with Elixir programming language
2. To understand the structure and functionality of Phoenix framework
3. To practice creating a web application using Elixir/Phoenix
4. To explore the process of creating release notes for an Elixir/Phoenix application

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Ensure you have Elixir and Phoenix installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
5. Create and migrate the database with `mix ecto.setup`
6. Start the Phoenix server with `mix phx.server`

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to see the application in action.
